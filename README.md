## 📂 Dataset

We used the popular **HAM10000** ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset:

📦 **Source**:  
[Kaggle Notebook Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/omarkhalil888/skin-cancer-classification-test-acc-97/notebook#Import-Data)

The dataset includes over 10,000 dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions, classified into 7 diagnostic categories.

## 🧠 Model: Swin Transformer

The Swin Transformer is a hierarchical vision transformer that computes representation with shifted windows, offering better performance for image classification tasks.

📌 **Why Swin Transformer?**
- Strong performance on image classification
- Scales efficiently for high-res inputs
- Better contextual understanding compared to CNNs
